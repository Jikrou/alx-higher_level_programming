 Python - Inheritance:
 Python supports inheritance, allowing classes to inherit attributes and methods from other classes. This enables the creation of hierarchical relationships, where subclasses can extend or modify the behavior of their parent classes. Inheritance promotes code reusability and helps organize code into logical structures. Subclasses can access the attributes and methods of their parent classes using the super() function, facilitating the implementation of polymorphism and encapsulation.
